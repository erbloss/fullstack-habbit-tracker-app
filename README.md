# app description:

    A personal habit tracker that allows a user to log in, create daily habits, and mark them as complete each day.  Users can view habit progress over time.

# tech stack:

    frontend = React (JavaScript)
    backend = Flask (Python)
    database = SQLite
    deployment = Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)

# setup instructions:

    from terminal (I used VS Code):
    python -m venv venv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd backend
    python app.py

    new terminal:
    cd frontend
    npm run build
    npm start

# live demo:

    NOTE: will eventually setup deployment via GitHub pages
